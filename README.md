# Harbour_EL (Extended Library)


## About this project
This repo takes on from the discontinued Harbour_VFP repo. It to include any functionality that can be used from Web and Desktop applications, and not limited to features equivalent to VFP (Microsoft Visual FoxPro).

View [ChangeLog.md](ChangeLog.md) for list of enhancements and fixes.

## Warnings
This library is to be used for 64-bit applications.

The Test folder currently only has one example: hb_el_Test.code-workspace (open with VSCODE)

Please go to https://harbour.wiki for articles, documentation and message board search engine.

## Development Note
When changing the version, update the files hb_el.ch, hb_el.prg (el_GetVersion()).

## Function List
* el_DateTime([nYear],[nMonth],[nDay],[nHour],[nMinute],[nSecond],[nFragment]) - Similar to hb_DateTime but with no milliseconds   
  hb_DateTime([nYear],[nMonth],[nDay],[nHour],[nMinute],[nSecond],[nFragment]) âž” <tTimeStamp>
Returns a timestamp value from the supplied day, month, year, hour, minute, second values and ignores nfragment. If none of them is supplied, the current date and time is returned.

* el_Seek(xExpression [, nWorkArea | cTableAlias   [, nIndexNumber | cIDXIndexFileName | cTagName]]) -> lFound   

* el_Between(xExpression,xLowValue,xHighValue) -> lResult    
  True if xExpression >= xLowValue and eExpression <= xHighValue   

* el_StrToFile(cExpression,cPathAndFileName,lAdditive) -> nBytesWritten   
  Write the cExpression to file located at cPathAndFileName. Will overwrite the file unless lAdditive is true.   

* el_dbf(nWorkArea | cTableAlias)  -> cTableName   
  Returns the name of a table open in a specified work area or a table name from a table alias. Not the entire file path.   
   
* el_InlistPos(xExpression,xExpression1 ... xExpressionx) -> nPosition   
  nPosition will retun 0 of xExpression is not any of the following expressions, or a value 1 to x to represent which expression is a match.   

* el_IsInlist(xExpression,xExpression1 ... xExpressionx) -> lResult   
  Return true if xExpression is any of the following parameters

* el_StrReplace(cString,cSource|acSource|hReplace,[cDest|acDest]) -> cResult   
  Case insensitive ready version of hb_StrReplace

* el_StrTran(cSearched,cExpressionSought,cReplacement,[nStart],[nCount],[nFlags])   
  If nFlags is -1 the search and replace are case insensitive.

* el_GetProcessID() -> iProcessID   
  Returns a Process ID. Only implemented for MS Windows and Linux

* EL_GetVersion() -> nVersion.  A Numeric with decimals representing the library version number.

* el_SendToDebugView(cMessage,[xValue]) -> .t.    
  Will send to debugview a message cMessage if xValue is missing and cMessage+xValue(converted to text) if xValue is present.

* hb_el_buildinfo() -> Text   
  Returns build information like the C compiler used and a timestamp

* el_AddPs(cPath) -> cPath
 Add trailing Path Separator if missing, as long as cPath is not empty (Equivalent to VFP AddBs())

## Precompiler Instructions
Review hb_el.ch for entire list.   
On of the most practical addition is the "scan / endscan" which was inspired by VFP.
